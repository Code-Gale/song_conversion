# Audio to MIDI Converter

## Project Overview

This Python project is designed to convert audio files into musical notes and generate MIDI files. It consists of two main components: `audioanalysis.py` and `midotrans.py`.

### Features

1. **Audio to Notes Conversion:** The `audioanalysis.py` script extracts musical notes from an audio file. It utilizes advanced audio analysis techniques to identify the pitch and duration of each note in the song.

2. **Tempo Detection:** This script also calculates the tempo (beats per minute) of the song, allowing you to precisely replicate the timing in the generated MIDI file.

3. **MIDI File Generation:** The `miditrans.py` script takes the musical notes obtained from the previous step and creates a MIDI file. MIDI is a versatile format that can be used in various music production and editing software.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The following Python packages:
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
  - [mido](https://github.com/mido/mido)
  - [librosa]

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pydub mido
```
```bash
pip install numpy librosa
```
```bash
pip install midi
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/github/audio-to-midi-converter.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd song_conversion
```

3. Run the `audioanalysis.py` script with the path to your audio file as an argument:

```bash
python audioanalysis.py path/to/your/audio/file.mp3
```

4. After extracting notes and tempo, run the `miditrans.py` script to generate a MIDI file:

```bash
python miditrans.py
```

The resulting MIDI file will be saved in the project directory.
